**Writing code, maintaining open-source software, solving problems. Also: rock concerts and traveling the world.**

Hi, I’m Philipp (`@phip1611`) — a passionate software engineer in my twenties.
I wrote my first lines of code at 14, but things really took off for me in
2016 during my university years. Since then, I’ve gained several years of
experience as a student software engineer, worked on numerous hobby and
university projects, and transitioned into the professional world.

I actively attend and [organize meetups](https://ukvly.org/), go to
conferences, engage with the community on GitHub and Reddit, and post about
things [on my blog](https://phip1611.de/).

My main areas of interest are low-level programming, kernels, device drivers,
and virtualization. On the methodology side, I focus on improving developer
productivity — through better tooling, clear documentation, thoughtful
refactorings, and developer-friendly workflows. Reproducible and easy-to-use
build systems and test setups are an essential step in that direction.
