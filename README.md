I am Philipp (`@phip1611`) and interested in Open Source development of modern,
robust, and high-quality software. Since 2016, I work professionally, as well
as in my free time, on a wide range of projects in different domains, such as 
low-level development (operating systems, micro controllers, virtualization,
device drivers) and small distributed enterprise web applications. I collected a
lot of skills for convenient machine and environment setups for a high developer
productivity, continuous integration, and more.

I am especially interested in investing time for a better developer productivity,
such as developer-focused tools, documentation, refactorings, and similar improvements.
Easy to use and reproducible build-systems are an important step towards these
goals.

### About

Especially, I enjoy creating various minimal examples with a good documentation
for topics and programming problems, where I am not satisfied with existing
open-source solutions. Whenever I come to the conclusion that the there is no
good or helpful guide available on the internet, I create one on my GitHub
and/or write about it in my blog <https://phip1611.de>.

**I see my future primarily in low-level development of firmware, operating systems,
kernels, and virtualization.**
In this process, I strive to transform ugly undocumented code to nice, well
documented, and easy to use code.
