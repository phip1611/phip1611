I'm Philipp (`@phip1611`) and interested in Open Source development of modern, robust, and good software.
In the last few years, I have worked professionally and in my free time on a wide range of subjects,
such as low-level development (operating systems, micro controllers, virtualization) and small distributed 
enterprise web applications. I gained a lot of skills for convenient machine and environment setups for 
a high developer productivity, continour integration, deployments, and more.

### About

I especially enjoy to create several minimal examples with a good documentation. Whenever I came to the
conclusion that the there is no such guide available on the internet, I create one on my GitHub and write
about it on my blog <https://phip1611.de>.

**I see my future primarily in low-level development of firmware, operating systems, kernels, and virtualization.**
In this process, I strive to transform ugly undocumented code to nice, well documented and easy to use code.
